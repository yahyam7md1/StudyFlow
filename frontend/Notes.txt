1- when you are in a session, lets say you are in your first break, then you didnt take the break exactly when it happened
so you want to reset it, so it start from the begininng, now when i did that it restarted the whole thing and even took me
out from the session, therefore, i want to fix it in the following way:
when i press reset, it should take me to sub window or smth, that asks me do you want to reset eveything form the begininng?
or reset the current session whateher its a break or focus time
